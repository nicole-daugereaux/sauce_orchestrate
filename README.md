# Simple Sauce Lab Examples
Very simple tests for Sauce Labs that don't require huge frameworks.

# Installing requirements
You may not need all the packages in the requirements file, but you can install them to your python like so (update the path as needed):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run command for local runs:

```
python puppySearch.py
```

or version-specific:

```
python3 puppySearch.py
```

To run with Sauce Orchestrate, see docs (which will tell you how to create registries, build docker images, etc) at https://docs.saucelabs.com/orchestrate/
