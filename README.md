# Simple Sauce Sauce Orchestrate Example


# Running locally for benchmark times:
While in the sauce_orchestrate directory, run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run command:

```
python3 puppySearch.py
```

# To run with Sauce Orchestrate, see docs (which will tell you how to create registries, build docker images, etc) at https://docs.saucelabs.com/orchestrate/

# Or if you're on a Mac like me, follow the steps below!

1. Make sure Docker is running locally by typing ```docker info``` in your terminal and hitting enter. You should get info back if itâ€™s running; otherwise, go open it.
2. In your terminal, type and run the following command while in the main sauce_orchestrate directory:

```
Docker build . --platform linux/amd64
```
3. Login to hub.docker.com (or create an account if you havenâ€™t done so already) , go to Repositories â†’ Create Repository
 
4. Name your repository ```sauce_orchestrate``` and leave it public

5. Now rebuild your image using your account and repository name
```
docker build -t <your-docker-username>/sauce_orchestrate:latest . --platform linux/amd64
```

6. Then run the following commands to login to Docker hub and push the image up to your repo:
```
docker login
docker push <docker-username>/sauce_orchestrate:latest
```

7. While in the sauce_orchestrate directory in Finder, make sure your hidden files are visible by pressing ```cmd+shift+.```.   Then go into the ```.sauce``` directory and open the ```config.yml``` (this is what tells saucectl to run the image). Edit it to match your info; your Docker username should be all that's needed.

8. Update or install ```saucectl```: https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/cli/saucectl/#installing-saucectl 
9. Type & run the command ```saucectl run ``` from the main SauceOrchestrateDemo directory that weâ€™ve been working in & you should be good to go! 
10. Compare those runtimes and look at that time savings! ðŸŽ‰
